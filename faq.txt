1. What is the base character used in the sims?
    * The base profile can be found in [sandbag.txt](sandbag.txt).
    * All items are from Mythic Castle Nathria.
    * Full 6 mastery gems are socketted and all available enchants are applied.
    * No gear has extra ilevel for being legendary.

1. What about conduits?
    * All sims include the covenant specific conduits and Fury of the Skies at rank 7.
    * Stellar Inspiration at current tuning contribute less than 1% and is not worth simming.

1. What about soulbinds?
    * As the value of different soulbind paths depend on the relative value of traits versus the conduit sockets, soulbinds will be included once it is known what rank of conduits will be available during the first tier.

1. What is the '1T Move' selection in the target dropdown?
    * This is a ***LARGELY UNOPTIMIZED APPROXIMATION*** of a light movement encounter. The simc raid_events can be found in [move.txt](move.txt). It consists of:
        * Each movement has a random distance of 20yd to 30yd
        * Movement starts when boss health reaches 95%
        * Movement repeats every ~30s to ~60s
    * There is no optimization of pooling and planning for movement
    * Fallback casts during movement are:
        * Starsurge if Balance of All Things is not equipped
        * Sunfire and Moonfire, starting with the lowest remaining duration

1. What is the 'Dungeon' selection in the target dropdown?
    * This is an ***UNOPTIMIZED, VERY CRUDE APPROXIMATION*** of a random dungeon-like encounter. The simc raid_events can be found in [mplus.txt](mplus.txt). It consists of:
        * Random light movement as per the '1T Move' script
        * ~450s total fight time
        * ~130s to ~150s fighting one mob
        * ~30s to ~50s fighting a wave of 3 to 7 mobs, each wave random and repeating until the end of the fight
        * Random 0s to ~20s wait after each fight

1. How does SimC handle Convoke the Spirits (Night Fae)?
    * SimC assumes it will cast ~3.5 healing spells, 1 Starfall if it isn't up, 1 Moonfire if you have a target without it, at least 1 Wrath, then roughly balance out the remaining between Starsurge, Wrath, and Moonfire on any further un-dotted targets.

1. How does SimC handle Kindred Spirits (Kyrian)?
    * SimC assumes that you are bonding with someone who does the exact same damage as you, and that 15% of the pool is lost from taking damage. The additional damage done by you AND your partner are attributed to you.

1. What about bugs on the Beta/PTR? Which are assumed to be fixed for the sims?
    * Currently there are no known bugs for Balance.

1. Are the sims updated for _____ ?
    * At the top of the HTML report, in the SimulationCraft banner, you will find the git build code.
    * Goto `http://github.com/simulationcraft/simc/commits/<enter git build code here>` to see all the changes to SimC that have been incorporated into the sim.

1. How can I run my own beta sims?
    * Full instructions for building SimC can be found in the SimC wiki <a href="https://github.com/simulationcraft/simc/wiki/HowToBuild" target="_top">HowToBuild</a> page.

1. How do I sim a covenant?
    * Add the line **covenant=covenant_name**

1. How do I sim a conduit?
    * Add the line **soulbind=conduit_name:rank/conduit2_name:rank/...**

1. How do I sim a legendary?
    * Legendary effects are added to gear as a bonus_id. Add the line for a tabard with the legendary effect from [leg_x_cov.txt](leg_x_cov.txt)

1. How can I see past sims to see how we've been nerfed/buffed?
    * With the BETA state of Shadowlands and things constantly in development, we can't easily show pre-/post- sims. This may change during the major patches once Shadowlands goes live.
