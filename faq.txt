    * Changes from the October 28th build 9.0.2.36401 are included.

1. What is the base profile used in the sims?
    * The base character can be found in [sandbag.txt](sandbag.txt).

1. What about soulbinds and conduits?
    * All sims include the covenant specific conduits and Fury of the Skies at rank 7.
    * Soulbinds and other conduits are 'coming soon'.

1. What is the '1T Move' selection in the target dropdown?
    * This is a ***LARGELY UNOPTIMIZED APPROXIMATION*** of a light movement encounter. The simc raid_events can be found in [move.txt](move.txt). It consists of:
        * Each movement has a random distance of 20yd to 30yd
        * Movement starts when boss health reaches 95%
        * Movement repeats every ~30s to ~60s
    * There is no optimization of pooling and planning for movement
    * Fallback casts during movement are:
        * Starsurge if Balance of All Things is not equipped
        * Sunfire and Moonfire, starting with the lowest remaining duration

1. What is the 'Dungeon' selection in the target dropdown?
    * This is an ***UNOPTIMIZED, VERY CRUDE APPROXIMATION*** of a random dungeon-like encounter. The simc raid_events can be found in [mplus.txt](mplus.txt). It consists of:
        * Random light movement as per the '1T Move' script
        * ~450s total fight time
        * ~130s to ~150s fighting one mob
        * ~30s to ~50s fighting a wave of 3 to 7 mobs, each wave random and repeating until the end of the fight
        * Random 0s to ~20s wait after each fight

1. How does SimC handle Convoke the Spirits (Night Fae)?
    * SimC assumes it will cast ~3.5 healing spells, 1 Starfall if it isn't up, 1 Moonfire if you have a target without it, at least 1 Wrath, then roughly balance out the remaining between Starsurge, Wrath, and Moonfire on any further un-dotted targets.

1. How does SimC handle Kindred Spirits (Kyrian)?
    * SimC assumes that you are bonding with someone who does the exact same damage as you, and that 15% of the pool is lost from taking damage. The additional damage done by you AND your partner are attributed to you.

1. What about bugs on the Beta/PTR? Which are assumed to be fixed for the sims?
    * The mastery value only updates roughly every 3 seconds.

1. Are the sims updated for _____ ?
    * At the top of the HTML report, in the SimulationCraft banner, you will find the git build code.

1. How can I run my own beta sims?
    * Full instructions for building SimC can be found in the SimC wiki <a href="https://github.com/simulationcraft/simc/wiki/HowToBuild" target="_top">HowToBuild</a> page.

1. How do I sim a covenant?
    * Add the line **covenant=covenant_name**

    * Add the line **soulbind=conduit_name:rank/conduit2_name:rank/...**

1. How do I sim a legendary?
    * Legendary effects are added to gear as a bonus_id. Add the line for a tabard with the legendary effect from [leg_x_cov.txt](leg_x_cov.txt)

1. How can I see past sims to see how we've been nerfed/buffed?
    * With the BETA state of Shadowlands and things constantly in development, we can't easily show pre-/post- sims. This may change during the major patches once Shadowlands goes live.
