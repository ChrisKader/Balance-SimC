## Updated November 7th <a href="https://github.com/balance-simc/Balance-SimC/commits/master/faq.txt" target="_top">(changelog)</a>

1. What's new?
    * Each covenant uses a possible soulbind & conduit loadout that may be the current best. See below for details on what specific loadout is used.
    * For each covenant & legendary combo, talents are simmed using the 'Smart Sim' setting. This means that for each covenant & legendary combo, **the talents that sim highest will be more accurate than the talents that sim the lowest.**
    * Eclipse Mastery snapshot & re-snapshot added to match new in-game behavior.
        - Eclipse will snapshot mastery when you enter eclipse via casting 2 generator or via Celestial Alignment/Incarnation.
        - When you cast Starsurge, Starfall, or Full Moon, any current eclipse will re-snapshot mastery.
        - Every ~3 seconds, any current eclipse will re-snapshot mastery.
    * Additional APL improvements for Kindred Spirits & Convoke the Spirits. See changelog in the APL for details.
    * Legendaries set to use ilevel 235 items with Haste & Mastery.
    * Convoke the Spirits updated based on latest raid testing logs. It now casts:
        - 15% chance to cast Full Moon
        - 3 to 5 heals
        - Starfall if it is not up
        - At least one more Wrath than all other damage spells
        - Remaining spells randomly selected between Wrath, Starsurge, and Moonfire (if there are undotted targets)

1. What about soulbinds and conduits?
    * Kyrian uses Pelagos with:
        - Combat Meditation
        - Fury of the Skies, Rank 7
        - Umbral Intensity, Rank 7
        - Let Go of the Past
    * Necrolord uses Emeni with:
        - Lead by Example

        - Fury of the Skies, Rank 7
    * Night Fae uses Niya with:

        - Niya's Tools: Burrs
    * Venthyr uses Theotar with:

1. What is the base profile used in the sims?
    * The base character can be found in [sandbag.txt](sandbag.txt).
    * All items are from Mythic Castle Nathria.
    * Full 6 mastery gems are socketted and all available enchants are applied.
    * Legendary items are set to ilevel 235 with Haste & Mastery.
    * All raid buffs and consumables are used.
    * 'Smart Sim' setting is used for each set of talents with a fixed covenant & legendary. This means that for each covenant & legendary combo, the talents that sim highest will be more accurate than the talents that sim the lowest.

1. What is the '1T Move' selection in the target dropdown?
    * This is a ***LARGELY UNOPTIMIZED APPROXIMATION*** of a light movement encounter. The simc raid_events can be found in [move.txt](move.txt). It consists of:
        * Each movement has a random distance of 20yd to 30yd
        * Movement starts when boss health reaches 95%
        * Movement repeats every ~30s to ~60s
    * There is no optimization of pooling and planning for movement
    * Fallback casts during movement are:
        * Starsurge if Balance of All Things is not equipped
        * Sunfire and Moonfire, starting with the lowest remaining duration

1. What is the 'Dungeon' selection in the target dropdown?
    * This is an ***UNOPTIMIZED, VERY CRUDE APPROXIMATION*** of a random dungeon-like encounter. The simc raid_events can be found in [mplus.txt](mplus.txt). It consists of:
        * Random light movement as per the '1T Move' script
        * ~450s total fight time
        * ~130s to ~150s fighting one mob
        * ~30s to ~50s fighting a wave of 3 to 7 mobs, each wave random and repeating until the end of the fight
        * Random 0s to ~20s wait after each fight

1. How does SimC handle Convoke the Spirits (Night Fae)?
    * Convoke the Spirits will cast:
        - 15% chance to cast Full Moon
        - 3 to 5 heals
        - Starfall if it is not up
        - At least one more Wrath than all other damage spells
        - Remaining spells randomly selected between Wrath, Starsurge, and Moonfire (if there are undotted targets)

1. How does SimC handle Kindred Spirits (Kyrian)?
    * SimC makes the following assumptions:
        - You are bonding with someone who does the exact same damage as you
        - 15% of the pool is lost from taking damage
        - The additional damage done by you AND your partner are attributed to you

1. What about bugs on the Beta/PTR? Which are assumed to be fixed for the sims?
    * Eclipse will snapshot mastery when you enter eclipse via casting 2 generator or via Celestial Alignment/Incarnation.
    * When you cast Starsurge, Starfall, or Full Moon, any current eclipse will re-snapshot mastery.
    * Every ~3 seconds, any current eclipse will re-snapshot mastery.
    * This behavior happens in-game and in SimC.
    * Adaptive Swarm will not jump onto an ally that already has a Swarm and will fizzle if there are no other friendly targets.

1. Are the sims updated for _____ ?
    * At the top of the HTML report, in the SimulationCraft banner, you will find the git build code.
    * Goto `http://github.com/simulationcraft/simc/commits/<enter git build code here>` to see all the changes to SimC that have been incorporated into the sim.

1. How can I run my own beta sims?
    * Full instructions for building SimC can be found in the SimC wiki <a href="https://github.com/simulationcraft/simc/wiki/HowToBuild" target="_top">HowToBuild</a> page.

1. How do I sim a covenant?
    * Add the line **covenant=covenant_name**

1. How do I sim a conduit?
    * Add the line **soulbind=conduit_name:rank/conduit2_name:rank/...**

1. How do I sim a legendary?
    * Legendary effects are added to gear as a bonus_id. Add the line for a tabard with the legendary effect from [leg_x_cov.txt](leg_x_cov.txt)

1. How can I see past sims to see how we've been nerfed/buffed?
    * With the BETA state of Shadowlands and things constantly in development, we can't easily show pre-/post- sims. This may change during the major patches once Shadowlands goes live.
